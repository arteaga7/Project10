Two profit analysis are performed by taking into account and without outliers in purchases to determine if there is a significant difference in the sample proportions. The Mann-Whitney U test is used to show if there exist a significant difference in the groups, for independent samples without normal distribution.

Finally, in order to avoid the "seeking-problem," the cumulative sum of profits throughout the analysis is used.
